        Welcome to C2, It's great to have you on board. <br><br>
        What if you could start your day knowing where all the risk 
        to your business lays, have enough context and not constantly 
        have to ramble through emails and notes for information?<br><br> That's the kind of workday C2
        wants to give you. 

        <br>
        <br>
        Get started by creating your own risk management programme or submitting a 
        response to someone else's. We've made risk so simple people can't quite believe it!
